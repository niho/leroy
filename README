Leroy

A simple high performance pub/sub server using AMQP and Sinatra. Supports
long-polling and WebSockets.

Usage:

  bin/leroy console   - Open an IRB console
  bin/leroy server    - Start the WebSocket server
  bin/leroy heartbeat - Send a heartbeat to the "test" channel every second
  bin/leroy listen    - Print messages on the "test" channel to stdout

To start the long-polling server you need to install the "thin" gem:

  gem install thin
  thin start

Examples:

/example.html  - An example long-polling client
/publish.html  - A simple form for sending messages to the "test" channel

WARNING

This is just a very simple prototype to prove a point. Do not use in
production!
